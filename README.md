Here's a list of some algorithms and data structures, grouped by category, that are essential to know:

# Sorting Algorithms:

- Merge Sort: O(*n* log *n*) average and worst-case time complexity. It's also stable.
- Quick Sort: O(*n* log *n*) average time complexity, but O(n<sup>2</sup>) in the worst case. It's generally faster in practice than other O(*n* log *n*) algorithms.
- Counting Sort, Radix Sort, Bucket Sort: Linear time non-comparison sorts, but they are not universally applicable like Merge or Quick Sort.

# Search and Traversal Algorithms:

- Binary Search: O(log *n*) for searching in a sorted list.
- Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS) for trees and graphs.

# Dynamic Programming:

Algorithms to solve problems like:
 - Knapsack Problem
 - Coin Change Problem
 - Longest Common Subsequence
 - Edit Distance

# Tree and Graph Algorithms:
- Dijkstra's and Floyd-Warshall for shortest path problems.
- Minimum Spanning Tree: Prim's and Kruskal's algorithms.
- Topological Sort

# String Algorithms:
- Rabin-Karp for substring search.
- KMP Algorithm for pattern searching.
- Z-algorithm for pattern searching.
- Trie Data Structure: Useful for efficient storage of strings and string matching tasks.

# Data Structures:

- Hashing: Understanding of hash tables, hash maps, and techniques to handle collisions.
- Trees: Binary trees, AVL trees, Red-Black Trees, Segment Trees, and Fenwick Trees (or Binary Indexed Trees).
- Heaps: Min-heaps, Max-heaps (priority queues).
- Disjoint Set/Union-Find: Useful for problems like network connectivity and in Kruskal's algorithm.
- Graph Representations: Adjacency list, adjacency matrix.

# Divide and Conquer:

- Problems like Closest Pair of Points.

# Bit Manipulation:

- Techniques to count bits, set or unset bits, etc.

# Geometric Algorithms:

- Though less frequent, problems related to points, lines, and polygons can appear.

# Probabilistic Algorithms:

- Bloom Filters and Reservoir Sampling.

# Backtracking:

- Solve problems like N-Queens, Sudoku, permutations, and combinations.
